Emacs major mode for ooc-lang.

* Quick setup
  Into a directory of your choice do...
  : git clone git://github.com/nixeagle/ooc-mode.git

  Take the full path of this directory, for example:
  : cd ooc-mode/ && pwd

  Edit your =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el= (whichever you have) with
  emacs and include the line:
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "<output of pwd above>")

  Tell emacs to reload that buffer with:
  : M-x eval-buffer RET

  Now just open any ooc file and emacs will use ooc-mode. If you want to
  have flymake support, be sure to do:
  : M-x load-library RET flymake-ooc RET

  Then turn flymake on as normal with: =M-x flymake RET=.


* Features

  Currently working:

  - automatic tab indention (still a few bugs...)
  - complex syntax highlighting.
  -M With flymake-ooc: instant compiler information seconds after you
    screwup on a line.


* Bugs, issues, problems...

  Please use the issues tab to report any issues.
